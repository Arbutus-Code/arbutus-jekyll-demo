      The Arbutus tree (Arbutus menziesii), also known as the Pacific Madrone, is the only native broadleaf evergreen tree in Canada. With its distinctive peeling bark and twisted branches, it stands as a resilient symbol of the Pacific Northwest coastal ecosystem.
      
      These magnificent trees can live for over 400 years and are perfectly adapted to the rocky shorelines and dry conditions of Vancouver Island.
