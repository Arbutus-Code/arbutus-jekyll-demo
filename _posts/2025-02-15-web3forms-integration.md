We're excited to announce the launch of our Spring Arbutus Conservation Initiative, a comprehensive effort to document, protect, and restore Arbutus tree populations across Vancouver Island. This initiative brings together community volunteers, researchers, and conservation partners in a coordinated approach to address the challenges facing these iconic trees.

## Why Arbutus Trees Need Our Help

The Arbutus tree (Arbutus menziesii) faces multiple threats in its native habitat:

* **Climate change** is altering precipitation patterns and increasing drought stress
* **Urban development** continues to fragment Arbutus habitats
* **Fungal diseases** like leaf blight have affected many trees in recent years
* **Deer browsing** prevents many seedlings from establishing successfully

Despite these challenges, there's hope. With targeted conservation efforts and community involvement, we can help ensure these magnificent trees continue to thrive along our coastlines.

## Get Involved

Our initiative includes several ways for community members to participate:

1. **Citizen Science Mapping**: Help document Arbutus populations using our mobile app
2. **Seedling Nursery**: Volunteer at our native plant nursery to grow Arbutus seedlings
3. **Restoration Planting**: Join our seasonal planting events at priority conservation sites
4. **Education & Outreach**: Help spread awareness about Arbutus conservation

No experience is necessary - we provide all training and equipment. Whether you can commit to a regular volunteer position or just attend a single event, your contribution makes a difference.
