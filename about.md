      The Arbutus tree (Arbutus menziesii), also known as the Pacific Madrone,
      is the only native broadleaf evergreen tree in Canada. Found along the
      southwestern coast of British Columbia, particularly on Vancouver Island
      and the Gulf Islands, these magnificent trees are a distinctive feature of
      our coastal landscape.


      With their smooth, cinnamon-red bark that peels away to reveal a green underbark, twisted branches, and glossy evergreen leaves, Arbutus trees are instantly recognizable and beloved symbols of our region's unique ecosystem.

      ## Distinctive Features


      The Arbutus tree is known for several unique characteristics that make it stand out in our coastal forests:


      * **Peeling Bark**: The smooth reddish-brown bark naturally exfoliates in thin curls, revealing a fresh green layer underneath that matures to a rich cinnamon color.

      * **Evergreen Leaves**: Thick, leathery, oval-shaped leaves with a glossy dark green upper surface and pale underside remain on the tree year-round.

      * **Flowers and Berries**: White, urn-shaped flowers bloom in spring, developing into bright red berries by fall that provide essential food for birds and wildlife.

      * **Growth Pattern**: Often growing with a twisted, sculptural form due to its adaptation to harsh coastal conditions.

      * **Size**: Can grow up to 30 meters tall in ideal conditions, though typically reaches 10-15 meters on Vancouver Island.

    heading: Cultural Significance
    text: >
      The Arbutus tree holds deep cultural significance for Indigenous peoples
      of the Pacific Northwest, particularly the Coast Salish Nations. Known as
      "qʷəl̕šəyʔ" in the Hul'q'umi'num language, these trees were considered
      sacred and used for various medicinal and practical purposes.


      The bark was used to treat stomach ailments, colds, and skin conditions, while the berries were occasionally consumed or used for dyes. The hard, dense wood was valued for tools, fishing hooks, and small carvings.


      Today, the Arbutus continues to be a powerful symbol of resilience, adaptation, and the unique character of our coastal ecosystems.
