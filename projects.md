      Our flagship conservation initiative involves mapping and monitoring Arbutus tree populations across Vancouver Island. Using GPS technology and citizen science, we're creating the most comprehensive database of Arbutus habitats ever assembled.
      
      This data helps us track population health, identify areas of concern, and prioritize conservation efforts. Our annual surveys involve dozens of volunteers who document tree size, health conditions, and evidence of regeneration.
      
      The resulting maps are shared with conservation partners, researchers, and land managers to inform protection strategies and policy decisions.

      Arbutus trees face numerous challenges to successful reproduction and establishment, including drought, deer browsing, and habitat loss. Our regeneration program addresses these challenges through several initiatives:
      
      * Collection and propagation of seeds from diverse local populations
      * Development of best practices for growing Arbutus seedlings
      * Restoration plantings in suitable habitats
      * Installation of protective measures for vulnerable young trees
      * Long-term monitoring of survival and growth rates
      
      Working with landowners, parks, and First Nations partners, we've established several Arbutus regeneration sites across Vancouver Island.

      Knowledge is a powerful conservation tool. Our education programs engage people of all ages in learning about and protecting Arbutus trees:
      
      * School programs that connect students with their local Arbutus habitats
      * Citizen science initiatives that gather valuable data while building public engagement
      * Workshops on Arbutus identification, ecology, and cultural significance
      * Development of educational materials, including field guides and online resources
      * Annual "Celebrate the Arbutus" festival that combines art, science, and conservation
